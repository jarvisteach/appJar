This project has been a labour of love over the last couple of years.  
When confronted with the difficulty both pupils and teachers were having creating simple GUIs with Python, I started out trying to put together a few helper functions to make life simpler.  
It's obviously grown a bit since then, and has become fairly functional!  
Due to the nature of its development, it can be quite clunky, and isn't necessarily the most optimal way of doing things.  
But, to the user (middle school students) - it (mostly) just works...
